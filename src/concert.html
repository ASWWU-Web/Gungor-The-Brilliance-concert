        Gungor is a Grammy-nominated musical collective formed by husband and wife duo Michael Gungor and Lisa Gungor.
        The band has released multiple albums, the last one appearing in March 2019. These albums explored a broad musical
        soundscape and charted the couple's changing beliefs. In early 2018, they announced a shift in direction that would
        see Gungor return to its Christian roots and the less mainstream material move to "other projects". This is Gungor's final tour!

      <p class="bio" id="brilliance">
        The Brilliance is a band made up of David Gungor and John Arndt. Their music evolved over the years from liturgical art,
        to peacemaking protest music, to focusing on music that inspires empathy. The duo started making music in 2010 and released
        a self-titled album, The Brilliance, on October 19, 2010.

        ways that you can get involved and actually meet The Brilliance if you are interested!
